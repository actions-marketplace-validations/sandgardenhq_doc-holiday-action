# Doc Holiday GitHub Action v1.0.0

Date: 2025-12-04
Version: 1.0.0

## New Features

- Introduced the Doc Holiday GitHub Action v1.0, a TypeScript-based action that integrates with the doc.holiday API to automatically generate release notes and documentation from GitHub releases, PR merges, or manually specified commit and tag ranges, running jobs in a fast, non-blocking fire-and-forget pattern.

## Improvements

- Added a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically generates release documentation with the Doc Holiday action whenever a GitHub release is published, using the configured DOC_HOLIDAY_TOKEN secret for authentication.
